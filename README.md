# webpage1
This project demonstrates the conversion of a frame-based webpage into a modern div-based layout using HTML and CSS. The website consists of a header, navigation bar, static sidebar, and dynamic content section. Iframes are used for controlled content loading to preserve the original frame-like behavior while adhering to HTML5 standards.
